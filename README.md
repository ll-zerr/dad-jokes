# Dad Jokes

This is the [Dad Jokes project (Day 10) in the Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to populate the page with a card that displays a random joke using the fetch API request.

## Features

- Random joke is displayed in a card container.
- Option of getting another random joke by clicking a button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

## My Process

- Start the files from a boiler template.
- Create the container to display a random joke.
- Add styles for the container and page.
- Create variables for the target elements.
- Create a function to generate the joke via a fetch API request.
- Add an event listener to the button in order to generate another joke.

### Continued development

This project is similar to another project I created using the fetch API. In the previous project - [Famous Quotes](https://github.com/ll-zerr/famous-quotes)- I utilized .then() to deal with the data response versus using async/await which is what is used for this particular project. I intend to continue exploring the use of fetch API requests in future projects.
